LFtoCRLF
========

Windows batch file to convert the End of Line from [LF] to [CR][LF].

Place all files with End of Line:[LF] inside the “input” folder, and run the batch file named “LFtoCRLF.bat”, after running the “LFtoCRLF.bat” file, you can find all the newly created files inside the “output” directory which are the [CR][LF] End of Line version of all files inside the “input” directory. Currently there is limitation of the batch file; it does only successfully convert those [LF] files whose name has no spaces inside the name.
